First, Big data arrives from a myriad of data sources, hence its shape and flavor differ. Second, hundreds of different Big data management systems support different APIs, storage/indexing schemes, and expose data to the users through their data model lens, each specific to their own system. All of these offer a significant impediment for Big data users who just want an easy to use interface to all relevant data regardless of its shape, format, size, and a backend system used to store it. Naturally, these differences also complicate development of any analytical algorithms on top of large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Here we describe HYBRID.POLY, a consolidated in-memory polystore engine, designed to support heterogeneous large-scale data and interactively process complex analytical workloads. We execute and evaluate several popular analytical workloads including Data Fusion, Machine Learning, and Music search at scale.\nFull text: Please refer to IEEE.\n","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554681600,"objectID":"0ca7c1ced77f74311e5defb480f2333f","permalink":"/publication/hybridpoly-icde/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hybridpoly-icde/","section":"publication","summary":"In 2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), Macao ","tags":null,"title":"Hybrid.Poly: A Consolidated Interactive Analytical Polystore System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maksim Podkorytov","Michael Gubanov"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that Variety is one of the most challenging problems in Big data research.
